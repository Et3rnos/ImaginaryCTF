## Frequently Asked Questions

**This project is composed by 2 different apps. Do I need to run both of them in order for it to work?**

ImaginaryCTF is composed by a website and a discord bot. The website is the responsible for challenge submissions while the discord bot is responsible for releasing them.
If you decide not to use the website then you would need to manually insert the challenges in the database. If you decide not to use the bot then you would need to manually release the challenges by modifying them in the database.
